### What?
If you are in need of a better on-line presence for your organisation, then relax. Using our tried and tested approach to on-line marketing and web development your organisation can reach more interested buyers, add more subscribers to your list or attract more supporters to your cause. 

Your on-line presence can be as simple as a one-page website with information about your organisation and a call to action. This simple start can achieve a lot, especially for those who have never previously taken the plunge.

However, with tools such as a Content Management System (CMS), blogging, email list management and comprehensive analytics tools being  easily accessible at no or low cost taking the step into more proactive on-line marketing has never been easier. The power of these tools has a levelling effect allowing smaller organisations to compete with  - and even overhaul - much bigger players in their niche. 

The process of developing a better on-line presence normally requires a fresh look at the organisation and a reassessment of the goals you wish to achieve. This can have a very positive and energising effect on the whole organisation.

Once you are up and running, with your fresh internet presence and accompanying tools, you and your team will feel like you have acquired super powers.  Your new super powers combined with robust, dependable technology gets you achieving more with less.

Technology is a tool for real growth. Organisations that were once dominant can be displaced by much smaller organisations with a good idea and the drive to implement it. Technology has never been cheaper or more accessible. Thanks mainly to advances in cloud computing even the smallest organisation can compete and become a dominant player in their industry. {The cloud model allows you to pay for what you use. You can quickly spin up more resources when needed and turn thatem off again with the same speed.

### Web Design
Your business goals drive our approach to web design. Once the purpose of your web presence is clear we design a website that will focus on accomplishing your goals.

As you are probably well aware a modern website must display on more platforms on a multitude of screen sizes and be delivered over networks that are slower than you or I are used to. In the 21st century some parts of the developed world are still only served by unreliable and slow connections. If you run a business in one of these locations or have customers in these locations then this will effect the overall design and implementation of your project. On the other hand, if you know that your audience are sitting in offices in front of large screen workstations running the latest browser software connecting via super fast broadband you know you can be more extravagant in the kind of content you wish to deliver. 

You may have the budget to create multiple web sites targeted at multiple audiences. Whatever your situation rest assured we will focus on delivering the most appropriate solution.

A good general approach is to build a website using the "mobile first approach" that works wonderfully well on small screen mobile devices and then add further content when a larger screen is detected. The mobile first approach delivers the smallest load possible to achieve the projects goals without making the mobile user wait.

A website design normally consists of a body of content and numerous templates and micro-templates which wrap the content for presentation to the visitor.

As well as packaging the content for the visitor the templates also contain meta data which is consumed by the web browser software on the visitors device as well as by the search engine indexing programs that regularly consume the content. This meta data improves the experience of the viewer as well as informing the search engine how your content might be indexed. The quality of the meta data influences the overall success of the project.

Companies spend millions creating brochures and distributing them. By having a website you can skip that entirely. Your potential customers can find out about you and any of your products online. If you get most of your business through networking and personal connections, then they will want to check out your website.

More customers
More than 2.4 billion people use the internet every day, and some 90% of those have purchased something, or contacted a company, online in the last 12 months. So by not having a website, you will be missing out on a big piece of the pie.

Influence

The internet has opened up a whole new world of marketing that didn’t exist before. Your website can attract new business by using a whole host of low cost marketing techniques.

Customer support
You can greatly reduce the cost of customer support by have a ticketing system, or even just an FAQ on your website. I can think of about 5 companies off the top of my head that streamline your customer service straight from your website.

Press releases
I know that sounds a bit far out, but it is true. You can run really cheap press releases online about your business, but to do it you will require a website. In fact, I have had clients who were absolute nobodies get one million views on YouTube because of online press releases.

 Beat the big guys
Have you ever wanted to get into business, but don’t know how to compete with all the big names out there? By creating an incredibly beautiful website with a solid strategy behind it you can smash the big guys to pieces. You have no chance of building bigger skyscrapers, but your website can break down the perceived wall between you and them.

Instant credibility
Have you ever had difficulty making that sale? Or convincing someone that you are the real deal. By having a well structured website you can foster instant credibility with anyone. You can provide the ultimate proof that you are, in fact, the realest of all deals (couldn’t resist that phrase).
