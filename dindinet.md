### What?
If you are in need of a better on-line presence for your organisation, then relax. Using our tried and tested approach to on-line marketing and web development your organisation can reach more interested buyers, add more subscribers to your list or attract more supporters to your cause. 

Your on-line presence can be as simple as a one-page website with information about your organisation and a call to action. This simple start can achieve a lot, especially for those who have never previously taken the plunge.

However, with tools such as a Content Management System (CMS), blogging, email list management and comprehensive analytics tools being  easily accessible at no or low cost taking the step into more proactive on-line marketing has never been easier. The power of these tools has a levelling effect allowing smaller organisations to compete with  - and even overhaul - much bigger players in their niche. 

The process of developing a better on-line presence normally requires a fresh look at the organisation and a reassessment of the goals you wish to achieve. This can have a very positive and energising effect on the whole organisation.

Once you are up and running, with your new internet presence and accompanying tools, you and your team will feel like you have acquired super powers.  Your new super powers combined with robust, dependable technology gets you achieving more with less.

Technology is a tool for real growth. Organisations that were once dominant can be displaced by much smaller organisations with a good idea and the drive to implement it. Technology has never been cheaper or more accessible. Thanks mainly to advances in cloud computing even the smallest organisation can compete and become a dominant player in their industry. {The cloud model allows you to pay for what you use. You can quickly spin up more resources when needed and turn thatem off again with the same speed.

Online brochure
Companies spend millions creating brochures and distributing them. By having a website you can skip that entirely. Your potential customers can find out about you and any of your products online. If you get most of your business through networking and personal connections, then they will want to check out your website.

More customers
More than 2.4 billion people use the internet every day, and some 90% of those have purchased something, or contacted a company, online in the last 12 months. So by not having a website, you will be missing out on a big piece of the pie.

Influence
By having a website potentially thousands of people are going to see it. You are able to influence people’s decisions and educate them.

Time to show off
You know that great feeling you get when people recognize your work? Well, by having a website you can show off what you do and take pride in your work.

Helps with business goals
That’s right! When it comes to writing the content for your website you are going to revisit things about your business that you haven’t in years. You will most likely reassess your business goals.

Low barriers of entry
Ever wanted to start a business? Well, now you can do it with virtual space. In fact, by using some free website providers you don’t have to pay a penny.

24 hours per day
Your website runs 24/7 without any supervision or need to lock it up. You can always be there for your customers.

Communication with customers
By having a blog or even just a feed on your website, you can update customers on your newest offers, products, promotions, events, photos, or any other content.

Marketing
The internet has opened up a whole new world of marketing that didn’t exist before. Your website can attract new business by using a whole host of low cost marketing techniques.

Customer support
You can greatly reduce the cost of customer support by have a ticketing system, or even just an FAQ on your website. I can think of about 5 companies off the top of my head that streamline your customer service straight from your website.

Press releases
I know that sounds a bit far out, but it is true. You can run really cheap press releases online about your business, but to do it you will require a website. In fact, I have had clients who were absolute nobodies get one million views on YouTube because of online press releases.

 Beat the big guys
Have you ever wanted to get into business, but don’t know how to compete with all the big names out there? By creating an incredibly beautiful website with a solid strategy behind it you can smash the big guys to pieces. You have no chance of building bigger skyscrapers, but your website can break down the perceived wall between you and them.

Instant credibility
Have you ever had difficulty making that sale? Or convincing someone that you are the real deal. By having a well structured website you can foster instant credibility with anyone. You can provide the ultimate proof that you are, in fact, the realest of all deals (couldn’t resist that phrase).
