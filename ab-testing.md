###A-B Testing

Most organisations have a a goal or goals that they wish to achieve on their website. They might want to sell more stuff, sign up more members or our favourite collect more email addresses. Getting higher conversion rates for your goals gives you a better return on investment on the costs involved in getting traffic. Especially if you are paying for your traffic. 

A/B testing or split testing is when you compare 2 different versions of the same page to determine which gives a better conversion rate. You may have an idea that your visitors prefer to click on a big yellow 'Join Us' button instead of a small red 'Join Us' button but you don't know for sure. An A/B test will allow your visitors to give you the difinitive answer. The Button with the highest conversion rate is the winner. Once this test is over you can test another idea. The text in the offer, the size oth the headings a photo on the page. The important thing with A/B testing is that you only test one element on the page at a time. You could run different tests on different pages concurrently.

If you want to improve then you should always be testing.
