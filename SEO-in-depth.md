##SEO Basics
###Create unique, accurate page titles
####Accurately describe the page's content
Choose a title that effectively communicates the topic of the page's content.
Avoid:
- choosing a title that has no relation to the content on the page
- using default or vague titles like "Untitled" or "New Page 1"

####Create unique title tags for each page
Each  of  your  pages  should  ideally  have  a  unique  title  tag,  which  helps  Google  know  how  the  page  is distinct from the others on your site.
Avoid:
- using a single title tag across all of your site's pages or a large group of pages

####Use brief, but descriptive titles
Titles can be both short and informative. If the title is too long, Google will show only a portion of it in the search result.
Avoid:
- using extremely lengthy titles that are unhelpful to users
- stuffing unneeded keywords in your title tags

- Make use of the "description" meta tag
