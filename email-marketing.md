Throughout the 20th century business empires were built on the back of direct marketing and the mailing list. Marketers discovered that once a prospect became a customer there was a high likelihood that they would buy multiple times. Over time the marketer would learn more about his customers and thus be able to better target his offers and increase his success and their company's profits. Direct marketing differs from general advertising in that it asks for and gets a response. The marketer places an advert in a newspaper or on the radio and ask for the reader or listener to respond with their details and usually a reference to where the advert was seen or heard. In this way the marketer would grow his mailing list. Mailing lists became a valuable asset and were often traded to other marketers who would share their offers with an audience that matched their target. Direct marketeers came to dominate some markets entirely. Unlike typical broadcast advertising direct marketing campaigns can be measured. Measurement allows copywriters to compete against the incumbent mailer piece, the control, with their copy to get a better response and return a higher profit for the company. 

Direct marketing also has a darker side with criminal gangs and unscrupulous marketers targeting vulnerable people with so called 'sucker lists'. A list that contains the details of people known to be an easy target for certain offers. Once you are on a list it is not always easy to get off. a reputable company will have a mechanism for removal. but if your name is on a list that is traded from company to company how do you remove your details from all the databases. Laws and industry standards have attempted to control the industry with so called no contact databases which marketers should use to clean their lists but it is not perfect.

Email and the internet have given the 'list' a new home. But this time the control to a large extent is in the hands of the receiver. A reputable company using a reputable email management system will provide links for instant removal from the list. If you are unlucky and your email address ends up on the list of an unscrupulous marketer or a criminal gang then you have the ultimate say. If things get too bad you can just close your email account. Many people set up disposable accounts with online email services like hotmail or gmail just for subscribing to email lists or responding to offers that that sound perhaps too good to be true.

The great news is that using email as a marketing tool is one of the most effective forms of marketing to reach your customers and prospective customers. Just like it's venerable postal ancestor it is measurable. Unlike direct marketing via the postal service it is much cheaper to create and distribute. Results data is available much more quickly, minutes to hours instead of days to weeks. Testing different versions of an offer to different segments of a list is much easier and for small to no cost to do. So for honest marketers direct marketing via email is better than ever. 

After you have put a great deal of thought and effort and perhaps money into driving a tsunami of visitors to your website the last thing you want is for them to disappear without taking any action.  A count in your website stats, a record of failure. Once the visitor has gone chances are they will never come back. Unless. Unless you have a way of contacting her and give her an  irresistible reason to come back. The best way we know and the most popular way by far is to collect email addressees and store them in an email list management system. Visitors do not give up their email addresses just because you ask them. You need to give them a compelling reason or enticement to get them to sign up. But the effort will pay off. Next time you have something to say that will interest your list members or an offer that will delight them all you need to do is open up your email management system enter your message and hit go. Every time you send out to your list you can guarantee a slew of traffic back to your website. Many businesses say that email is the winner for driving sales and results.


Compared to any other marketing medium  email allows you to reach out more often to more people for a fraction of the cost of other methods.
