###Data Collection

Data is an asset. Good data is a more valuable asset. The more we know about our customers the better we can serve them. Our websites generate data about visits. Our e-commerce systems generate sales data. Our A/B tests collect visitor preference data. Our email management systems collect and manage data visitor contact and interest data. But sometimes we might want to reach out and ask our visitors opinion on a topic. We might simply want to know their opinion on an either or issue. We might want a more in depth survey on a topic: Customer Satisfaction Surveys. Market research surveys. Some companies use the data collected from surveys as the basis of new products. This is especially successful for people involved in knowledge and training products.

Whatever data you want to collect you will need a system that collects and securley stores the data in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction of the visitor. A system that allows you to analyse the results to give you the answer to your questions.

We can advise you the best option for your requirement. We have experience with free to use online systems all the way through to bespoke systems built specifically for a purpose. We can move and reformat data from any system so that it can be transferred to another system or even combined with the data in another system.
