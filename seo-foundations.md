#SEO Fundamentals


###What is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)?
SEO is important to all businesses who want search engines to send visitors to their website. It doesn't matter if you run a small local family business or a large public company. If your website is optimised for what someone types into the search engine your business will appear in the search results listing. How easy it is to get a prominent position listing will depend on how well you optimise for a particular search phrase and how many businesses are competing for that phrase. Chances are you will be competing on more than one phrase. And just having that phrase at the top of you web page is not SEO. 

###So what is involved in SEO?

SEO is divided into two main categories: On-site and Off-site.
{{On-site SEO consists of the elements that exist on your website such as text and meta data, and in your websiteâ€™s HTML code, over which you have control. }}

###OnSite SEO
Onsite SEO broadly consists of *design and layout*, *coding* and *content*.

The *design and layout* of your website is important for SEO and more importantly for the experience of your website visitors. While the search engines cannot see the visual design of your site, they can see the structure. Navigation and page layout should be well designed and structured to allow visitors to easily access the information they are looking for and instruct search engines how to index your pages.  

A poorly *coded* website will be slow to load. Visitors do not like slow loading websites and will abandon their visit sooner. Search engines will score your site lower for slow loading.

*Content* has the biggest effect on your success. The search engines reward good quality content which exists for a purpose. Equally, visitors reward good quality content by engaging  with it, taking the actions outlined in it and sharing your content with others.

Google recommends to website owners that they should focus on website visitors and their needs. A good Content Strategy should focus on the target audience and their needs as well as the business goals of the website owners.

###Offsite SEO
Offsite SEO includes all the factors that influence your website's search engine rankings but are not on the website itself. This includes links to your content from other sites, reviews of your products, services or content on other websites and, of course, social network shares and mentions. Although these factors are offsite, they are influenced heavily by your onsite SEO. Nobody will link to, share or give good reviews to poor quality content. 

So we could say:
