#SEO Foundations


###What is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
SEO is important to all businesses who want search engines to send visitors to their website. It doesn't matter if you run a small, local family business or a large public company. If your website is optimised for what someone types into the search engine your business will appear in the search results listing. How easy it is to get a prominent position listing will depend on how well you optimise for a particular search phrase and how many businesses are competing for that phrase. Chances are you will be competing on more than one phrase. And just having that phrase at the top of you web page does not constitute optimising. 

So what is involved in SEO. 

SEO is divided into 2 types. On page SEO and Off Page SEO. 

SEO is divided into two main categories: On-site and off-site. On-site SEO consists of the elements (such as text and meta data) that exist on your website, and in your websiteâ€™s HTML code, over which you have control. 

Onsite SEO broadly consists of Design & Layout, coding and content.

The Design & Layout of your website is important for SEO and more importantly for the experience of your website visitors. While the search engines cannot see the visual design  of your site they can see the structure. Navigation and page Layout should be well designed and structured to allow visitors to easily access the information they are looking for and instruct search engines how to index your pages.  

A poorly coded website will be slow to load. visitors do not like slow loading websites and will abandon their visit sooner. Search engines will score your site lower for slow loading.

Content has the biggest effect on your success. The search engines reward good quality content which exists for a purpose. Equally visitors reward good quality content by engaging  with it, taking the actions outlined in it and sharing your content with others.

Google recommends to website owners that they should focus on website visitors and their needs. A good Content Strategy will focus on the target audience and their needs as well as the business goals of the website owners.

Onsite SEO is dependent upon a well designed and implemented website with great content. 

Offsite SEO are all factors that influence your search engine rankings but are not on your website itself. This includes links to your content from other sites, reviews of your products, services or content on other websites and of course social network shares and mentions. Although these factors are offsite they are influenced heavily by your onsite SEO. Nobody will link to, share or give good reviews to poor quality content. 

So we could say that Offsite SEO is dependent upon a well designed and implemented website with great content.



But what is it and why do you need it? SEO, as the name suggests, is the process of building and optimising your website so that it is found by search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing.

##SEO Basics
###Create unique, accurate page titles
####Accurately describe the page's content
Choose a title that effectively communicates the topic of the page's content.
Avoid:
- choosing a title that has no relation to the content on the page
- using default or vague titles like "Untitled" or "New Page 1"

####Create unique title tags for each page
Each  of  your  pages  should  ideally  have  a  unique  title  tag,  which  helps  Google  know  how  the  page  is distinct from the others on your site.
Avoid:
- using a single title tag across all of your site's pages or a large group of pages

####Use brief, but descriptive titles
Titles can be both short and informative. If the title is too long, Google will show only a portion of it in the search result.
Avoid:
- using extremely lengthy titles that are unhelpful to users
- stuffing unneeded keywords in your title tags

- Make use of the "description" meta tag

### Improve Conversions before driving more traffic

If you had a hole in your bucket you wouldn't try to carry more water in it until you had fixed the hole. You would be crazy no? but lots of organisations spend lots of time, effort and money getting traffic to their websites only to see the traffic bounce without converting. Before you invest resources into capturing traffic you need to fix your conversion problems.  Test test Test.
